  \item A shared communications channel has a bandwidth of 3 Mbps.
    Each subscriber requires a bandwidth of 150 kbps when
    using the channel.
    Each subscriber uses the channel only 10\% of the time.

    This means that the capacity of the channel is sufficient to
    allow simultaneous communications by $20$ subscribers.

    This means that the probability $p$ that any given subscriber is active at any given moment
    is $0.1$.

    The probability that exactly $n$ of $N$ subscribers are simultaneously communicating
    when the probability that any individual subscriber is communicating is $p$ is:

    \begin{align*}
      P_{p} (n \mid N ) & = \frac{N!}{n! (N - n)!} (p)^n (1.0 - p)^{N - n}
      \end{align*}

    The probability that exactly n of 120 subscribers are simultaneously communicating
    is\ldots

    \begin{align*}
      P_{0.1} (n \mid 120 ) & = \frac{120!}{n! (120 - n)!} (0.1)^n (1.0 - 0.1)^{120 - n}
      \end{align*}

    With the help of a \href{http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx}{calculator}
    we can find the probability that $21$ or more
    subscribers are active at once.
  
    The online calculator displays input fields for ``Probability of success on a single trial,''
    ``Number of trials,'' and ``Number of successes (x).''
    Enter values of $0.1$, $120$, and $21$ in these fields
    Click on the calculate button.
    Look for the probability that $21$ or more subscribers are simultaneously active
    in the output field that is labeled ``Cumulative probability: $P(X \ge 21)$.''

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that at any given moment
        $21$ or more subscribers will be communicating?
      \item What happens in a packet switched network when subscribers
        request more bandwidth than the channel can provide?
      \item What can you infer from this result about an advantage
        of packet switched communications?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 0.79 percent.
    \item In networks with overly high traffic intensity, clients will experience packet loss; that is, packets arriving at the router will find a 
	full queue, and be dropped.
    \item In a packet switched network, a dropped packet can be simply retransmitted, 
	forgoing the need to retransmit entire messages, or sit through an excessively long queue.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How many bits are in an IPv4 address?

    \item If all bits in an IPv4 address were available for specifying
      addresses of different machines on the Internet, how many hosts
      could the Internet connect?

    \item The dotted decimal notation is a way of writing IPv4 addresses.
      
      Find the IPv4 address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ by typing:

      \verb+nslookup www.eonsahead.com+

      Express the IPv4 address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ in
      dotted decimal notation.?

    \item The dotted decimal notation presents an address as
      four decimal numbers, each in the range of $0$ to $255$,
      and separated from one another by periods.

      A number $x$ in the range of $0$ to $255$ can be expressed
      in hexadecimal notation with two hexadecimal digits.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The first (most significant) digit is $x / 16$.
        The division is integer division.

      \item The second (least significant) digit is $x \bmod 16$.

      \item Here is an example: $77_{10} \equiv 4D$ because\ldots
      \begin{itemize}
        \item  $77 / 16 = 4$
        \item $77 \bmod 16 = 13$
        \item the hexadecimal digit that represents $13$ is $D$
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{tabular}{ll|ll}
      \textbf{decimal} & \textbf{hexadecimal} & \textbf{decimial} & \textbf{hexadecmal} \\ \hline
      0 & 0 & 8 & 8 \\

      \end{tabular}

      \end{itemize}

      Express the address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ in hexadecimal
      notation.

    \item To translate a number from hexadecimal format to binary,
      replace each hexadecimal digit with the corresponding
      four bits bound in this table:

      \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \textbf{Hexadecimal digit} & \textbf{Binary equivalent} \\ \hline
        0 & 0000 \\
        1 & 0001 \\
        2 & 0010 \\

  \item An IPv6 address contains 128 bits. With 128 bits, it
    is possible to represent $2^{128}$ addresses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Look up the current population of the earth. What integer
      power of two most closely approximates this number?
    \item What is the integer power of ten that most closely
      approximates $2^{128}$?

      Here are some relationships that you might find helpful.

      \begin{align*}
        2^{10} & \approx 1000 = 10^3 \\
        2^{20} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^6 \\
        2^{30} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx 10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^9 \\
        2^{40} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx
            10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^{12}
        \end{align*}

      In general, if $2^x = 10^y$, then $y$ is approximately equal to $x/y$: $2^{40} \approx 10^{40/3}$.
      
    \item How many IPv6 addresses would each person on earth have if the addresses
      were evenly distributed?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 33 $(2^33)$
    \item 38 $(10^38)$
    \item Approx. $2^95$, or 40 trillion quadrillion.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Hundreds of millions of IPv4 addresses are reserved.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For what purposes are the CIDR address blocks 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16 reserved?
    \item How many addresses are in the 10.0.0.0/8 block?
    \item How many addresses are in the 192.168.0.0/16?
    \item Use the \verb+ifconfig+ command to determine the IP address of
      one of the Linux machines in our laboratory. What is the address of the computer?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item These addresses are reserved for \textbf{realms}, aka a network whose IP address is only relevant to other hosts in the network.
    \item $2^24$ (16.8 million).
    \item $2^16$ (65 thousand).
    \item 10.101.6.7
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Port numbers are $16$ bit addresses. A $16$ bit address is large
    enough to specify any one of $65536$ different ports. What is a programmer
    addressing when a programmer specifies a port number?

  \begin{answer}
    A port number is a transport layer address reserved for the use of specific network applications. When specifying
	a port number, a programmer must be sure to not use one of the 1024 well-known ports, and should pick something unused
	(or at least relatively obscure).
    \end{answer}

  \item Here is an address: d4:9a:20:0a:49:00
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The format of this address matches the format of what kind of address?
    \item What does the address identify?
    \item The address contains 12 hexadecimal digits. How many bits are needed
      to specify this kind of address?
    \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A MAC (Media Access Control) address. This is a link layer address.

    \item 48 bits.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item What kinds of addresses do the headers in each of these kinds
      of packets contain? (Your choices are IP addresses, MAC addresses,
      and port numbers.)

    \item Network layer datagrams
    \item Link layer Ethernet frames
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Port numbers

    \end{answer}

  \item DHCP is a client-server protocol.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What does this service provide to clients? (It may provide more than one item.) 
    \item Under what circumstances is a DHCP service especially useful?
    \item Which transport level protocol and which port number is used by
      a host to discover a DHCP server?
    \item DHCP uses an IP address that is reserved for broadcast. 
      A host that joins a network is a client.
      The exchange between a DHCP client and a DHCP server begins when
      the client broadcasts a \emph{discover message}.
      The client broadcasts this message because it does not yet know
      any addresses (including most particularly the address of the DHCP
      server) in the network.
      The server responds by broadcasting an \emph{offer message}.

      Why does the server also broadcast the \emph{offer message}?

    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item DHCP will automatically assign either a permanent or temporary IP address to each host when it connects to the network. 
	It also provides the host with local network information, including its subnet mask, the first-hop router address, and the DNS server address.
    \item DHCP is useful in large networks where hosts may be constantly leaving and entering. In public WiFi networks, this ensures a user can enjoy a temporary
	IP address, and in resedential networks, it allows the ISP to pool large userbases in smaller, dynamically controlled subnets.
    \item DHCP uses UDP at port 67.
    \item At this stage, the host does not yet have an assigned IP address. The only messages it is able to receive are broadcasts across the subnet.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item What are several possible objections to the use of NAT?

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item NAT uses arbitrary port numbers to identify local hosts, rather than as process addresses. This can cause problems for servers
	on the local network that may wait for data at specific, well known ports.
    \item There may be security/privacy risks. NAT routers process data up to the transport layer, whereas other routers only need processing
	up to the network layer.
    \item As another security risk, NAT routers work specifically by acting as a middle man, modifying IP addresses and port numbers to
	redirect traffic. 
    \item NAT is an unnecessary patchwork solution to IP address shortage that would be rendered obsolete under IPv6 protocol.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item DNS and ARP both translate between two kinds of addresses.

  \item In the following table, the first four elements of the
    first four rows are data. The fifth element in each of the 
    first four rows is a parity bit computed for that row.
    The elements of the fifth row are parity bits computed
    for the columns.

    The parity bits have been chosen to make the number of
    ones in a row (or column) even.
    For example, only one of the data bits in the first row
    is a one. Making the parity bit a one makes the total
    number of ones in the row even.

  \begin{tabular}{llll|l}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\

    Now suppose that noise in the communication line
    alters a bit during the transmission of this table.
    The receiver sees this table:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What can the receiver know?
      \item What can the receiver do?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item By counting the bits in each row and column, and noting the tallies that are odd, the receiver
	knows which rows and columns are missing bits (R3, C3, in this case).
    \item By matching erroneous rows and columns, the receiver can simply invert the intersecting bit.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item This problem is about a CSMA/CD network.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $d_{prog}$ be the upper bound on the time required
      for front edge of a signal to travel (propagate) between two network adapters (interfaces).
    \item Let $d_{tran}$ be the time required to transmit the largest frame.
    \item Let $E$ be the efficiency of the network. ``Efficiency'' means the
      fraction of time (computed over a long run) in which frames are passing
      between adapters without collision. Assume that there are many adapters
      with many frames to send.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{align*}
    E & \approx \frac{1}{1 + 5 \cdot \frac{d_{prog}}{d_{tran}}}
    \end{align*}

    Here is an analogy: Imagine a large school. There are many rooms.
    A single hallway connects the rooms. At unpredictable times, groups of students in
    one room pass through the hall to another room. A group of art
    students might move from the studio to the library. Another group of
    students might later move from the chemistry laboratory to the gymnasium.
    After that, a third group of students might walk from their English class to
    the nurse's office.

    A rule forbids more than one group of students to be in the hall at once.
    If the chemistry students open the door and see the art students in the hall,
    they must duck back into their laboratory, check the hallway for traffic
    again at a later time, and proceed only when the see at that the hallway
    is empty.

    In this case, $d_{prog}$ is a measure of how fast the students walk,
    and $d_{tran}$ is a measure of how much time it takes to get a group
    of students through a classroom door into the hall.
    The amount of time that a group spends in the hall is a function
    both of how fast the students walk and how many students are in the
    group.

    Efficiency is the fraction of time during which there are students
    in the hallway moving between rooms.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Does $E$ increase when $d_{prog}$ is increased or when it is decreased?
      \item Does $E$ increase when $d_{tran}$ is increased or when it is decreased?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item When it is decreased
    \item When it is increased
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Both routers and switchs store and forward packets.
    Routers execute layer 3 protocols. In layer 3, IP addresses determine
    where packets go.
    Switches execute layer 2 protocols. In layer 2, MAC addresses determine
    where packets go.
    Even so, network administrators can often choose to connect two networks
    using a router instead of a switch (or vice versa). 
    Network adminstrators need to know the advantages and disadvantages of
    each kind of device.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Hierarchical addressing and an easier avoidance of cycles (an attractive characteristic)
      is a property of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \item ``Plug-and-play'' (an attractive characteristic) is a property of which
      kind of device: router or switch?
    \item Faster processing of packets (an attractive characteristic) is a property
      of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \item The option of choosing from a greater variety of topologies (an attractive characteristic)
      follows from the selection of which kind of device: routers or switches?
      A greater variety of topologies means freedom from the constraint of avoiding multiple links
      between elements in a network. The network need not be a spanning tree, but can be a more
      general kind of graph.
    \item Susceptibilty to broadcast storms (an unattractive characteristic) is a property
      of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Router
    \item Switch
    \item Switch
    \item Router
    \item Switch

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The computation is a long division. As in any long division, the computation
      requires subtractions of multiples of the divisor. How does the method of subtraction
      differs from ordinary subtraction? 
    \item What is the bit string that the sender will transmit?
    \item What kinds of errors can the receiver detect?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There are no borrows in modulo-2 subtraction. All bits are converted to zeros except ORs $(1-0, 0-1)$.
    \item 0100
    \item Consecutive bit errors less than $r+1$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}
