    <much more document text following here (not shown)>
    
     a. Was the server able to successfully find the document or not? What time
        was the document reply provided?
            Yes, I think so. The document reply was provided at 12:39:45GMT tme on Tuesday, March 7th, 2008.
            You can find this via the Date: line, and I can see it found the document because it is presenting an awful
            lot of information about the document. The very last line actually says the reply shows the text from the
            document.
        
     b. When was the document last modified?
            The document was last modified on Saturday, December 10th, 2005 at 6:27 PM GMT. You can find this by looking
            at the 'Last-Modified' line.
            
     c. How many bytes are there in the document being returned?
            3874 bytes I think? Based on these lines here:
            <cr><lf>AcceptRanges: bytes<cr><lf>Content-Length: 3874<cr><lf>

     d. What are the first 5 bytes of the document being returned? Did the server
        agree to a persistent connection?
            I think the first five bytes are "<!doc"? If I'm not mistaken that when the actual document begins being
            displayed, but honestly I'm not sure.
            The server does agree to a persistent connection, and you can tell that because of this line: <cr><lf>Connection:
            Keep-Alive<cr><lf>
            
            
            
    Question 2. Page 289. P5. Suppose that the UDP receiver computes the Internet checksum for the received
    UDP segment and finds that it matches the value carried in the checksum field.
    Can the receiver be absolutely certain that no bit errors have occurred? Explain.
