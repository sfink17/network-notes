            Vinton Gray Cerf, or perhaps better known as one of the Fathers of the Internet, is one of the most important inventors
        in computer science. Born in New Have, Connecticut in 1943, a young Cerf quickly learned that he suffered from severe
        hearing impairment. Though almost certainly not his only reason, Cerf has said that this hearing impairment was partially
        why he took an interest in computer science, in the hopes that it could prove to be another avenue for the hearing impaired
        to communicate.
            Whatever the reason, Cerf graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1965. He turned to work at IBM as a
        systems engineer, where he contributed to a project, Quicktran, that piqued his interest in further Computer Science
        work. he left IBM after two short years, and began attending the University of California. There, Cerf earned his M.S.
        in 1970, and a PHD in Computer Science two years later in 1972.
            During his time at UCLA, Cerf would meet the man who would share his title as Father of the Internet. Cerf was
        working on a project to write the communication protocol for the ARPANET, the first computer network to use packet
        switching. During this time Cerf met Robert E Kahn, an electrical engineer from Brooklyn who was five years his
        senior. Kahn was also working on the ARPANET project, and the two formed a professional relationship, working to
        predict and diagnose issues with the network.
            After graduation, Cerf would find himself back at Stanford, only this time as part of the faculty. While working
        there, Cerf was approached by Kahn, who came to ask for his assistance in designing a new network he had thought up.
        This network was a huge network of packet-switching networks, a network of networks. In other words, an inter-net.
        Together, the two of them (and many contributing colleagues) produced TCP/IP, the basis for the current internet.
            After his work producing TCP/IP, Cerf continues to be an activist in promoting and expanding the internet. In 1982,
        Cerf became the vice president of MCI Communications Corporation, where he was the driving force of developing and
        deploying the first commercial email service connected to the internet. Since then, Cerf became the founding member
        of the Internet Society, a non-profit organization, in 1992. Perhaps their mission statement best explains what they
        do, ""to promote the open development, evolution, and use of the internet for the benefit of all people throughout
        the world." Today, they have over 80,000 members. In 2004, along with Robert E. Kahn, Cerf would win on of the
        highest honors in Computer Science, the Turing award.
