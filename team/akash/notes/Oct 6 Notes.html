        <h3>File Transfer: FTP</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP and FTP are file transfer protocols with similar characteristics (both run on top of TCP)</li>
            <li>Differences: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>FTP uses two parallel TCP connections (a control connection and a data connection) to transfer a file.</li>
                    <li>Since FTP uses a different control connection it is said to send control information out-of-band. HTTP meanwhile send this information in-band.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A control connection sends information such as user identification, password, commands to change remote directory, and commands to put/get files.</li>
                            <li>Data connection is used to actually transfer the file</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>    
            <li>Commands sent in 7-bit ASCII format (people readable)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>USER: send user information to the server</li>
                    <li>PASS: Send user password to server</li>
                    <li>LIST: retrieve lists of file in the directory</li>
                    <li>RETR: retrieve file from directory</li>
                    <li>STOR: store file in directory</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Electronic Mail in the Internet</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>User agents: allow users to read, reply to, forward, save and compose messages. Like Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail.</li>
            <li>Mail Server: Forms the core of the email infrastructure. This where mailboxes are stored which are responsible sending and receiving emails.</li>
            <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): Principal application layer protocol for email. It uses the reliable data transfer service of TCP to transfer mail. It has two sides: a client side and a server side.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>HTTP and SMTP</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Persistenet Connection</li>
                    <li>HTTP is a pull protocol: Users use HTTP to pull information from a web server.</li>
                    <li>HTTP encapsulates each object(text, images etc) as its own HTTP response messages</li>
                </ul>
            <li>SMTP</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Persistenet Connection</li>
                    <li>SMTP is a push protocol: the sending mail server pushes the file to the receiving mail server</li>
                    <li>SMTP requires 7-bit ASCII format. Therefore multimedia data needs to be encoded when it is sent over SMTP and decoded back once it is received.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Mail Access Protocols</h3>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
