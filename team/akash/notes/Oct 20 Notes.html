    <h4>Link-Layer Addressing and ARP</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A link-layer address is variously called a LAN address, a physical address, or a <b>MAC address</b></li>
        <ul>
            <img src="../images/notes/MACAddress.png" alt="MAC Address">
            <li>MAC address is 6 bytes long, giving 2^48 possible MAC addresses</li>
            <li>If a sending adapter wants all the other adapters on the LAN to receive and process the frame it is about to send it inserts a special <b>MAC broadcast address</b> into the destination address field of the frame</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</b> is used to translate between network-layer addresses and link-layer addresses</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each host and router has an <b>ARP table</b> in its memory, which contains mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses.</li>
        </ul>
