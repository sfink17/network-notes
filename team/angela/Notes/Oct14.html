	<h2>4.4.1 Datagram Formate(331-335)</h2>
	<ul> 
 	<li>network-layer packet is referred to as a datagram. and the key feild are as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>Version number: 4 bits that specify the IP protocol version of the data gram and by looking at it the router can determine how to interpret the remainder of the IP datagram</li>
<li>Header length: 4 bits that specify where in the IP datagram the data actually begins </li>
<li>Type of service: 8 bit that specify different types of IP datagrams. for instance real time vs. non real time traffic
</li>
<li>Datagram length: 16 bit that specify the length and intersting fact:the theoretical maximum size
of the IP datagram is 65,535 bytes. However, datagrams are rarely larger than
1,500 bytes!</li>
<li>Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset: three feilds that are all to do with IP fragmentation but the book was questionable about it because in the future there will be contradtions like that now a days there is no IP framentaion allowed.   </li>
<li>Time to live: 8 bit and we have delt with this so.. </li>
<li>Protocal: 8 bit that is only used when it reaches its final destination. That specify transport layer protocol to which data portion to look at. this is super interesting.  </li>
<li>Header checksum:16 bit which we have also talked about so...</li>
<li>Source and destination IP addresses:32 bit holds the source IP address into source and ultimate destination into the destination IP address fields</li>
<li>Options:The options fields allow an IP header to be extended, Header options
were meant to be used rarely</li>
<li>Data (payload): the actual data wanting to be sent</li>
</ul>
</ul>
