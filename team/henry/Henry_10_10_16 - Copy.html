    <h4>Congestion Control: 3.6</h4>
    <p>As always, it is best to examine this topic by looking at increasingly complex scenarios until we understand 
    the full concept</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Scenario 1: Two Senders, a Router with Infinite Buffers
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Assume that hosts A and B share a connection link which has infinite buffer space and a sending rate 
                    of R.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this scenario, neither host can achieve a throughput higher than R/2.  Not only that, but as each 
                    host approaches a throughput of R/2, the delay on the connection link will rise exponentially.
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the sending rate exceeds R/2, the number of queued packets is unbounded, and the average delay 
                    between sender and receiver becomes infinite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this scenario, operating at a sending rate near R is optimal for maximum throughput and for keeping the router busy, but is 
                    problematic in terms of delay times.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Scenario 2: Two Senders and a Router with Finite Buffers
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When a router has a finite buffer space as it would in the real world, incoming packets are dropped 
                    when they arrive at a router with a full queue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second assumption we make in this scenario is that both connections are reliable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a packet is dropped, the host will eventually resend it.  This means that our use of the term 
                    <i>sending rate</i> is slightly altered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rate at which the original data <i>and</i> retransmitted data is send to the transport layer 
                    is referred to as the <i>offered load</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The added complication of this layer is that our performance is now heavily dependent on how we handle
                    retransmission. If a host could somehow (magically!) determine whether the router has a free buffer 
                    space, no packets would be lost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a realistic scenario, some duplicate packets will be sent when the host reaches its timeout value 
                    and the packet is delayed in the network and not yet at the receiver.  This is a cost of a congested 
                    network.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Scenario 3: Four Senders, Routers with Finite Buffers, and Multihop Paths
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This scenario contains a number of new assumptions that are best handled one at a time.  The first 
                    is that we now have four hosts as opposed to two.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
