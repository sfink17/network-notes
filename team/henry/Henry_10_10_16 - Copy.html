    <h4>Multiplexing and Demultiplexing</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            A multiplexing/demultiplexing service is needed for all computer networks.
        </li>
        <li>
            The transport layer has the job of delivering the data from the network layer to all the appropriate 
            application processes.
            </li>
        <li>
            In order to send data to the appropriate application out of those running on a single machine, a number 
            of steps must occur.
        </li>
        <li>
            The transport layer has a number of attributes.
            <ul>
                <li>Each applicaton has one or more dedicated sockets, therefore the transport layer must 
                merely know the appropriate socket for delivery.</li>
                <li>Each socket is either a UDP or TCP socket.</li>
                <li>Each transport layer segment has a number of fields which designate the appropriate socket.</li>
                <li>The job of determining the appropriate socket and parsing off the correct segments falls to 
                is called demultiplexing.</li>
                <li>The process of examining transport layer segments and concatenating them to pass to the network 
                layer is called multiplexing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each port number on a computer is a 16-bit number ranging from 0 to 65535.
        </li>
        <li>
            Source and destination port number fields are sockets on a machine which are designated for either 
            transmission or reception, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            The port numbers ranging from 0 to 1023 are called well-known port numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            To summarize:
            <ul>
                <li>Each socket is designated a port number.</li>
                <li>When a segment arrives, the transport layer examines the destination port number and 
                and send the segment to the correct socket.</li>
                <li>The data in the segment passes through the port and to the application.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Connectionless Multiplexing and Demultiplexing</h4>
    <p>There are a few important distinctions to make in this section as compared to the previous one.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When a UDP socket is created, it is automatically unassigned a non-well-known port number.</li>
        <li>A UDP designated segment includes a "return to sender" identifier of the source's port number.</li>
    </ol>
