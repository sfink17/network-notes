    <h3>Principles of Reliable Data Transfer</h3>

                The reliable transfer of data is central to the success of any networking implementation and is an issue at 
                many levels of computing
            </li>
            <li>
                In this section we see how TCP utilizes the principles of networking that are described herein.
            </li>
            <li>
                On a reliable channel, no transferred bits are corrupted or lost, and are all delivered in the order they 
                were sent.
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the key troubles of RDT is that the layer below the data transfer protocol may be unreliable.
            </li>
            <li>
                For our purposes we will assume that packets will be delivered in the order that they were sent, with potential 
                for some being lost, and that the lower layer is simply an unreliable point-to-point channel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unidirectional data transfer is data sent only from sender to receiver, whereas bidirectional data 
                transfer (full duplex) sends and receives data both ways.  Here we will discuss only unidirectional.</li>
            <li>
                Even in unidirectional data transfer, packets must be sent in both directions.  In addition to packets containing 
                the data, there will need to be control packets sent back and forth.
            </li>
        </ol>
