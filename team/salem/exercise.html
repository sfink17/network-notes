<h1>About Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
<div>Tim Berners-Lee&#39s is a prominent and respected member of the development of data communications.  He was the inventor of the World Wide Web.  In addition, he also has some titles and accomplishments:</div>
<ul>
	<li>The inventor of the World Wide Web (2).</li>
	<li>Successfully started the connection between a HTTP client and server (2).</li>
	<li>Founded and currently directs the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web (2)(3).</li>
	<li>Is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) (2).  In addition to Artificial Intelligence, they also do research on computational biology, graphics and vision, language and learning, theory of computation, robotics, and others (4).</li>
	<li>The director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) (2).</li>
</ul>
<div>He had an interview at the Web 2.0 summit.  There was a cover done by cnet.  One of topics was about law and whether technology should handle law.  He beleives policemen and courts should decide right from wrong, not technology.  He also gave advise on how &#34If you want it everywhere, give it away.&#34  This was the idea that if you want it everywhere, you do not charge for the service.  He warned that large companies are a threat.  Social networks, like Facebook, might monopolize communication because they are not open to other systems.  However, he gave hope.  If small companies connection their network on a standard connection, then they could topple large companies.  Trust was one of the last subject he talked about.  He says that in order for the world of web apps to take off is trust.  Unfortunately, he did not have the answer to this. (1)</div>

	<h1 style = "text-align:center">Q&A</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>What are the two requirements for transport-layer multiplexing? (page 192)</li>
			<ol class = "answer">
				<li>Sockets have unique identifiers.</li>
				<li>Each segment has special fields that indicate the socket to which the segment is to be delivered.
		</li>
			</ol>

		<li>Give a quick definition for demultiplexing and multiplexing. (page 191)</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>Demultiplexing: The receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identify the receiving socket and then directs the segment to that socket.</li>
				<li>Multiplexing: Gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information</li>
			</ul>

		<li>Why would you chose UDP over TCP? (page 199)</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>as soon as an application process passes data to UDP, UDP will package the data inside a UDP segment and immediately pass the segment to the network layer.</li>
				<li>UDP just blasts away without any formal preliminaries.</li>
				<li>TCP segment has 20 bytes of header overhead in every segment, but UDP only has 8 bytes of overhead.</li>
			</ul>

		<li>What is checksums and how is it used? (page 202 to page 204)</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>It is 16-bits that is added to a packet and is used to prevent corruption.</li>
				<li>By converting all the 0s to 1s and converting all 1s to 0s.  When added it should produce 1111111111111111.  If there is a 0 in the sum, then there is an error in that packet.</li>
			</ul>

		<li>Match the correct rdt with the correct added feature or basic feature. (page 206 to page 215)</li>
			<ul class = "answer"><li>Answer:</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>rdt 1.0</li>
				<ul>
					<li>sender and receiver.</li>
					<li>Just one state.</li>
					<li>Perfectly reliable.</li>
				</ul>

				<li>rdt 2.0</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Positive acknowledgments and negative acknowledgments.</li>
					<li>Reliable data transfer protocols based on such retransmission are known as ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols.</li>
					<ul><li>Error detection</li><li>Receiver feedback</li><li>Retransmission</li></ul>
				<li>This deals with the problem of corrupt packets.</li>
				</ul>

				<li>rdt 2.1</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Field that has a sequence number into the field, which is 1-bit sequence number. It will allow the receiver to know whether the sender is resending the previously transmitted packet.  This is to deal with the problem of ACK or NAK packets being corrupt.</li>
				</ul>

				<li>rdt 2.2</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The receiver must now include the sequence number of the packet being acknowledged by an ACK message</li>
					<li>The sender must now check the sequence number of the packet being acknowledged by a received ACK message.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>rdt 3.0</li>
			</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Countdown Timer, which needs to be able to:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Start the timer each time a packet is sent.</li>
						<li>Respond to a timer interruption.</li>
						<li>Stop the timer.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>This is to deal with lost packets.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

		<li>What are the names of the three major components of a TCP congestion-control algorithm? (page 272 to page 277)</li>
			<ul class = "answer"><li>Answer:</li></ul>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>Slow Start</li>
				<li>Congestion Avoidence</li>
				<li>Fast Recovery</li>
			</ul>

			<li>What is the well-known port numbers.  And, what are they used for? (page 192)</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>0 to 1023.</li>
				<li>Those ports are used for things such as HTTP (port number 80) and FTP (port number 21).</li>
			</ul>

		<li>How does sequential number help with rdt? (page 210)</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>It helps distinguish between packets and to keep track of which ACK or NAK responded to which packet.</li>
			</ul>

		<li>What is a three-way handshake? (page 232)</li>
			<ol class = "answer">
				<li>The client first sends a special TCP segment.</li>
				<li>The server responds with a second special TCP segment</li>
				<li>The client responds again with a third special segment, confirming their connection.</li>
			</ol>

		<li>What is a congestion window? (page 269)</li>
			<ul class = "answer">
				<li>Imposes a constraint on the rate at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the network, denoted cwnd.</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>

	<ol>
		<li><h4>P29 pg 294:</h4></li>
		<ol>
			<ul>
				<li>Question: Why is it necessary for the server to use a special initial sequence number in the SYNACK?</li>
				<li class = "answer">Answer: To make sure that the user trying to connect is an actual person and not part of an attack because the hash that is stored in a cookie is gained from the source and destination IP and port numbers of the SYN segment.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Question: Suppose an attacker knows that a target host uses SYN cookies. Can the attacker create half-open or fully open connections by simply sending an ACK packet to the target? Why or why not?</li>
				<li class = "answer">Answer: No, you cannot do a half-open connection, however; if you sniffed the network and got the packet and etc.  then you can spoof and make a full connection with the ACK.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Question: Suppose an attacker collects a large amount of initial sequence numbers sent by the server. Can the attacker cause the server to create many fully open connections by sending ACKs with those initial sequence numbers? Why? </li>
				<li class = "answer">Answer: Yes, because you can just spoof yourself and use the initial sequential numbers to make full-connections.</li>
			</ul>

		</ol>
<div style = "margin-top:15px"><b><i>I collaborated with Nigel Ticknor for P29.</i></b></div>

		<li><h4>P16 pg 290:</h4></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Question: Suppose an application uses rdt 3.0 as its transport layer protocol. As the stop-and-wait protocol has very low channel utilization (shown in the crosscountry example), the designers of this application let the receiver keep sending back a number (more than two) of alternating ACK 0 and ACK 1 even if the corresponding data have not arrived at the receiver. Would this application design increase the channel utilization? Why? Are there any potential problems with this approach? Explain.</li>
				<li class = "answer">Answer: Yes, it might increase the channel utilization, however; it would be at the risk of corruption because the ACK 0 and ACK 1 were made to keep track of which ACK went with which packet.  If there is a corrupted packet, then the server cannot ask for another transmission of that packet because it does not keep track of which packet needs to be resent.</li>

	<div>I have completed the lab on HTTP and worked a little on TCP. Here is the link to <a href = "lab.html">my lab</a>.  


One of the exercise that was about authorization.  In order to do this lab you will need to know a little bit of how Wireshark works and know what HTTP is.  If you need help on Wireshark or need a refresher, <a href = "http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/Wireshark_Intro_v7.0.pdf">read this pdf</a>.  Or if you would like to read about HTTP before starting Wireshark, here is a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"> Wikipedia article about HTTP</a>.  Now when we talk about authorization.  Authorization in computer science is a way to have only certain people have access to something, like bank account, amazon account, or school email.  In order to get an authorization you need credentials.  Credentials is usally a username and password.  We will look at how HTTP deals with authorization.



If you type http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html into the url, it will take you to another screen, and a pop up will appear asking for you username and password.  Meanwhile on Wireshark, the client sent a GET HTTP and the server responded with a 401 Unauthorized.</div>
	<img src = "pic/401.png" style = "margin:20px">

	<div>401 Unauthorizated means that we did not have the right authentication/credential.  However, if we type in the correct username and password (in this case, username is "wireshark-students" and password is "network"), then the client sends another GET HTTP, except with a new field called Authorization with the credentials.</div>
<img src = "pic/authorization.png" style = "margin:20px">

	<div>Since you have the correct authorization, you gain access to the web page which give you the contect and we have a 200 OK instead 401 Unauthorized.</div>
