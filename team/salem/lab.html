</div>

<div class = "qa">9. Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the 
contents of the file?   How can you tell?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: No, but it returned content because the main server had not been modified</div>

<div class = "qa">10. Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP

<div class = "aq">Answer: One, 89. Since there was a lot of other packets sent before this was sent.</div>

<div class = "aq">Answer: 91, 200 OK</div>

<div class = "qa">14. What is the status code and phrase 
in the response?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: 200 OK</div>

<div class = "qa">15. How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to
carry the single HTTP response and the text of the
Bill of Rights?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: Only one</div>

<div class = "qa">16. How many HTTP GET request messages
did your browser send?  To which Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: 3 HTTP GETs were sent, Initial Page address and the image: 128.119.245.12 and the 5th addition picture is from 128.119.245.90</div>

<div class = "qa">17. Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel?  Explain.</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: serially because the date for one pecket is later than the second packet.</div>

<h2>TCP</h2>
<div class = "qa">1. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?  To answer this question, it’s probably easiest to select an HTTP message and explore the details of the TCP packet used to carry this HTTP message, using the “details of the selected packet 
header window” (refer to Figure 2 in the “Getting Started with Wireshark” Lab if 
you’re unce
rtain about the Wireshark windows.</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: Ip: 192.168.1.102  port:1161</div>

<div class = "qa">2. What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments for this connection?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: Ip: 128.119.245.12</div>

<div class = "qa">3. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer (source) to transfer the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: Ip: 192.168.1.102 port:1161</div>

<div class = "qa">4. What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu?  What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a 
SYN segment?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: The sequence number is 0.  Next to the flags segment has the (SYN).</div>

<div class = "qa">5. What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in reply to the SYN?  What is the value of the 
Acknowledgementfield in the SYNACK segment?  How did gaia.cs.umass.edu 
determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a 
SYNACK segment?</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: The sequence number is 0.  The sequence number is 1.  Next to the flags segment has the (SYN, ACK).</div>

<div class = "qa">6. What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command?  Note that in order to find the POST command, you’ll need to dig into 
the packet content field at the bottom of the Wireshark window, looking for a 
segment with a “POST” within its DATA field.</div>
<div class = "aq">Answer: 164041.</div>
