    <h1>The Network Layer</h1>
    <p>The role of the network layer is to move packets from a sending host to a receiving host. 
    <h2>Network Address Translation -- NAT</h2>
    <p>NAT is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP datagram packet headers wile they are in transit across a traffic routing device. NAT is essentailly the virtualization of IP addresses. NAT adds secuirty and decreases the number of IP address an organization/household needs.</p>
    <h4>NAT Translation Table</h4>
    <p>The NAT table is the heart of the whole NAT operation. This takes place inside of the router or any NAT-enabled device. The translation table is created to help the router determine what to do with all incoming packets on all of its interfaces.</p>

    <h2>IPv4 & IPv6</h2>

    <p>IPv4 uses 32 bits for its Internet addresses. That means it can support 2^32 IP addresses in total — around 4.28 billion. Thats awesome right? Not really. Unforunately all 4.28 billion IP addresses have been assigned.</p>
    <p>So what do we do?</p>
    <p> IPv6 utilizes 128-bit Internet addresses. Therefore, it can support 2^128 Internet addresses — 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of them to be exact. So that is pretty awesome.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Transition from IPv4 to IPv6</h4>
    <p><b>Dual Stack Routers.</b> A router can be installed with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses configured on its interfaces pointing to the network of relevant IP scheme.</p>
    <p><b>NAT Protocol Translation.</b> This is another important method of transition to IPv6 by means of a NAT-PT (Network Address Translation – Protocol Translation) enabled device. With the help of a NAT-PT device, actual can take place happens between IPv4 and IPv6 packets and vice versa. A host with IPv4 address sends a request to an IPv6 enabled server on Internet that does not understand IPv4 address. In this scenario, the NAT-PT device can help them communicate. When the IPv4 host sends a request packet to the IPv6 server, the NAT-PT device/router strips down the IPv4 packet, removes IPv4 header, and adds IPv6 header and passes it through the Internet. When a response from the IPv6 server comes for the IPv4 host, the router does vice versa.</p>
