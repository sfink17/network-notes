<button class="accordion">Wireshark</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Today in lab, I worked through the Wireshark lab for TCP. I uploaded a text file of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> to the books website. Using Wireshark, I was able to see the packets being sent as I did this.I was able to track my IP and the IP address of Gia.cs.umass.edu. I was able to track a series of TCP segments that have been sent between my computer and gia.cs.umass.edu.</p>

<button class="accordion">Reading</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Reading sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3.</p>
  <p>I focused on the connection-oriented and connectionless transport. Also, I tried to fully understand checksums as they will be important when it comes to RDT.</p>

<button class="accordion">Accordions</button>
<div class="panel">
