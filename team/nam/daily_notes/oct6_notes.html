		<h1>CHAPTER 2.3: File Transfer: FTP</h1>
		<h4>In a typical FTP session:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>The user interacts with FTP through an FTP user agent.</li>
			<li>The user provides the hostname of the remote host, causing the FTP client process in the local host to <b>establish</b> a <b>TCP connection</b> with the FTP server process in the remote host.</li>
			<li>The user then provides the user identification and password, which are sent over the TCP connection as part of FTP commands</li>
			<li>Once the server has authorized the user, the user copies one or more files stored in the local file system into the remote file system (or vice versa).</li>
		</ol>
			<p>TCP uses two parallel TCP connections to transfer a file, a <b>control connection</b> and a <b>data connection</b>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The control connection (port 21) is used for sending control information between the two hosts - information such as user indetification, password, commands to change remote directory, and commands to "put" and "get" files.</li>
				<li>The data connection (port 20) is used to actually send a file</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because FTP uses a separate control connection, FTP is said to send its control information <b>out-of-band</b>. HTTP sends request and response header lines into the same TCP connection that carries the transferred file itself. For this reason, HTTP is said to send its control information in-band.</p>
			<p>The control connection remains open throughout the duration of the user session, but a new data connection is created for each file transferred within a session.</p>
			<p>Throughout a session, the FTP server must maintain state about the user. Keeping track of this state information for each ongoing user session significantly constrains the total number of sessions that FTP can maintain simultaneously.</p>
			<p>The commands, from client to server, and replies, from server to client, are sent across the control connection in 7-bit ASCII format.vSome of the more common commands are given below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>USER username: Used to send the user identification to the server.</li>
				<li>PASS password: Used to send the user password to the server.</li>
				<li>LIST: Used to ask the server to send back a list of all the files in the current remote directory. The list of files is sent over a (new and non-persistent) data connection rather than the control TCP connection.</li>
				<li>RETR filename: Used to retrieve (that is, get) a file from the current directory of the remote host. This command causes the remote host to initiate a data connection and to send the requested file over the data connection.</li>
				<li>STOR filename: Used to store (that is, put) a file into the current directory of the remote host.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each command is followed by a reply, sent from server to client. The replies are three-digit numbers, with an optional message following the number. Some typical replies, along with their possible messages, are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>331 Username OK, password required</li>
				<li>125 Data connection already open; transfer starting</li>
				<li>425 Can’t open data connection</li>
				<li>452 Error writing file</li>
			</ul>
