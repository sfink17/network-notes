            <h1 class="section">CHAPTER 3.7: TCP Congestion Control</h1>
         </div>
         <h3 class="section">1. How a TCP sender limits the rate at which it sends traffic into its connection:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>TCP must use end-to-end congestion control rather than network- assisted congestion control, since the IP layer provides no explicit feedback to the end systems regarding network congestion.</li>
            <li>The TCP congestion-control mechanism operating at the sender keeps track of an additional variable, <span>the congestion window</span>.</li>
            <li>The congestion window, denoted <span>cwnd</span>, imposes a constraint on the rate at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the network.</li>
            <li>LastByteSent – LastByteAcked <= min{cwnd, rwnd}</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 class="section">2. How a TCP sender perceives that there is congestion on the path between itself and the destination:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Because TCP uses acknowledgments to trigger (or clock) its increase in congestion window size, TCP is said to be <span>self-clocking</span>.
               <ul>
                  <li>If acknowledgments arrive at a relatively slow rate (e.g., if the end-end path has high delay or contains a low-bandwidth link), then the congestion window will be increased at a relatively slow rate.</li>
                  <li>On the other hand, if acknowledgments arrive at a high rate, then the congestion window will be increased more quickly.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Optimizing the sending rate:
               <ul>
                  <li>A lost segment implies congestion, and hence, the TCP sender’s rate should be decreased when a segment is lost.</li>
                  <li>An acknowledged segment indicates that the network is delivering the sender’s segments to the receiver, and hence, the sender’s rate can be increased when an ACK arrives for a previously unacknowledged segment.</li>
                  <li>Bandwidth probing: Given ACKs indicating a congestion-free source-to-destination path and loss events indicating a congested path, TCP’s strategy for adjusting its transmission rate is to increase its rate in response to arriving ACKs until a loss event occurs, at which point, the transmission rate is decreased.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
