        Notes for October 10th
    </h1>
<ul>
	<li>Modern Internet uses one of two transport protocols: TCP or UDP</li>
	<li>Transmission Control Protocol</li>
	<li>User Datagram Protocol</li>
	<li>Network application deveoper chooses TCP or UDP based on the needs of the application</li>
	<li>A packet in the transport layer is called a segment</li>
	<li>(some things call UDP packets datagrams, but this textbook says nah that's too confusing)</li>
	<li>TCP/UDP as a whole is called the Internet Protocol (IP)</li>
	<li>Best-effort delivery serviece - makes every attempt to deliver segments, but makes no guarantees</li>
	<li>Not guaranteed -> unreliable service</li>
	<li>TCP/UDP extend IP's delivery service between two end systems to a delivery service between two processes on those systems</li>
	<li>^Transport-layer Multiplexing and Demultiplexing^</li>
	<li>Integrity checking: include error-detection fields in segment headers</li>
	<li>UDP</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Only provides data delivery and error checking, no frills</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Unreliable service - does not guarantee that data will arrive intact or at all</li>
			<li>No congestion control - any connection can send as much as it wants for as long as it wants</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>TCP</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensures reliable data transfer</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgements, timers</li>
			<li>Keeps sending data until all of it has been confirmed to arrive in the correct order</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Provides congestion control</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Prevents any one TCP connection from swamping links and routers with excessive traffic</li>
			<li>Attempts to give each connection in a congested link an equal share of bandwith</li>
			<li>Regulates rate at which sending sides of a TCP connection can send information</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
