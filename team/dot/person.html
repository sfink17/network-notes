	<p><b>Abhay Bhushan</b> was born on November 23, 1944. He was among the first class to graduate from the Indian Institute of
		Technology Kanpur in 1965 with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. He continued his studies at MIT, receiving
		a Masters in Electrical Engineering and a degree in Management. While at Kanpur, he began working on the first draft of
		<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114">RFC 114</a>, the origin of FTP. (RFC stands for Request For Comments, a document
		written by engineers and computer scientists in memorandum format to describe methods, behaviors, research, or innovations
		relevant to the Internet.) He continued work on the protocol for some time, finally publishing RFC 114 while at MIT on April
		16, 1971. RFC 114 detailed, as stated in its introduction, "<i>a "first cut" at a protocol that will allow users at any host
		on the network to use the file system of every cooperating host.</i>" While the protocol has undergone several changes over
		the years, notably in the 1980s when it was upgraded to use TCP/IP instead of NCP, the base idea remains the same as the
		original protocol established by Bhushan. The specific vocabulary and phrasing of commands have changed as well to become
		slightly more readable by humans, but the basic layout and functionality of the commands remain as Bhushan defined them in
		1971.
		FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which defines the method in which a control connection and data connection run in
		parallel to transfer files between a client and a server. It maintains state, unlike HTTP, storing certain user and session
		information until the connection is closed.</p>
