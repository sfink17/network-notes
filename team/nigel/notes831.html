<b>Logical Communication</b> - From an application's perspective, hosts are directly connected.<br>
Application message -> <b>segment</b><br>
<b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b> - reliable, connection-oriented service<br>
<b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</b> - unreliable, connectionless service<br>
<b>IP (Internet Protocol)</b> is a <b>best-efford delivery service</b>  - It makes its "best effort" to deliver segments, but <i>offers no guarantee</i>.<br>
IP is said to be an <u>unreliable service</u>.<br>
<b>transport-layer multiplexing</b> and <b>demultiplexing</b> - Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery.<br>
<b>TCP</b> offers <b>reliable data transfer</b> and congestion control.<br>
<b>Congestion Control</b> - prevents any one connection from swamping the links and routers between hosts.<br>
A process may have more than one socket.<br>
<b>socket</b> - where data passes from process to network<br>
<b>well-known port numbers</b> - ports 0-1023.<br>

<h3>UDP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does <i>as little as possible</i>.</li>
<li><b>No Handshaking</b> - <i>connectionless<i></li>
<li>Useful for applications that are okay with data loss</li>
<li>Small packet overhead</li>
<li>There is a checksum</li>
</ul>
<b>end-end principle</b> - error detection on <i>end-to-end basis</i>.
