<br>
<b>Broadcast Routing</b> - The network layer delivers a packet from a source to all other nodes.<br>
<b>Multicast Routing</b> - The network layer delivers a packet from a source to a specific node/nodes.<br>
<b>N-Way Unicast</b> - Duplicating a packet for each destination node.<br>
<b>Flooding</b> - A source node sends a copy of the packet to all neighbors.<br>
<b>Sequence Number Controlled Flooding</b> - Flooding with a source address and a broadcast sequence number.<br>
<b>Broadcast Sequence Number</b> - Unique sequence number for the packet.<br>
<b>Reverse Path Forwarding</b> - When a router recieves a packet, it transmits to all outgoing links only if the packet is on its shortest path back to the source.<br>
<b>Spanning Tree</b> - A tree that contains all nodes in a graph.<br>
<b>Minimum Spanning Tree</b> - Spanning tree whose costis the minimum of all the graph's spanning trees.<br>
<b>Center-Based Approach</b> - Center Point is defined, then nodes unicast tree-join messages to the center.<br>
<b>Address Indirection</b> - Single identifier used for a group of recievers.<br>
<b>Multicast Group</b> - A group of nodes associated with a class D multicast address.<br>
<b>Soft State</b> - A state is removed via timeout.<br>
<b>Multicast Routing Problem</b> - Routers who do not need a packet must have the packet routed through them anyway to reach a destination.<br>
<b>Pruning</b> - A router that recieves multiple multicast packets it doesn't need will send a pruning message upstream.<br>
<b>Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol</b> - Source-based trees with reverse path forwarding and pruning.<br>
<b>Protocol-Independant Multicast Routing Protocol</b> - Recognizes 2 scenarios: When group members are densely located, and when they are sparsely located.<br>
<b>Source-Specific Multicast</b> - Only a single sender may send traffic into a multicast tree.<br>
