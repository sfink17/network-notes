<b>Link Layer Services</b>
<ul>
<li><u>Framing</u> - Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer datagram
within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link. A frame consists
of a data field, in which the network-layer datagram is inserted, and a
number of header fields. The structure of the frame is specified by the link-layer
protocol. We'll see several different frame formats when we examine specific
link-layer protocols in the second half of this chapter.</li>
<li><u>Link Access</u> - Amedium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules by which
a frame is transmitted onto the link. For point-to-point links that have a single
sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link, the
MAC protocol is simple (or nonexistent)-the sender can send a frame whenever
the link is idle. The more interesting case is when multiple nodes share a single
broadcast link-the so-called multiple access problem. Here, the MAC protocol
serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the many nodes.</li>
<li><u>Reliable Delivery</u> - When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service, it
guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error.
Recall that certain transport-layer protocols (such as TCP) also provide a reliable
delivery service. Similar to a transport-layer reliable delivery service, a link-layer
reliable delivery service can be achieved with acknowledgments and retransmissions
(see Section 3.4). A link-layer reliable delivery service is often used for links
that are prone to high error rates, such as a wireless link, with the goal of correcting
an error locally-on the link where the error occurs—rather than forcing an end-toend
retransmission of the data by a transport- or application-layer protocol. However,
link-layer reliable delivery can be considered an unnecessary overhead for low
bit-error links, including fiber, coax, and many twisted-pair copper links. For this
reason, many wired link-layer protocols do not provide a reliable delivery service.</li>
<li><u>Error Detection & Correction</u> - The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can
incorrectly decide that a bit in a frame is zero when it was transmitted as a one,
and vice versa. Such bit errors are introduced by signal attenuation and electromagnetic
noise. Because there is no need to forward a datagram that has an error,
many link-layer protocols provide a mechanism to detect such bit errors. This is
done by having the transmitting node include error-detection bits in the frame,
and having the receiving node perform an error check. Recall from Chapters 3
and 4 that the Internet's transport layer and network layer also provide a limited
form of error detection-the Internet checksum. Error detection in the link layer
is usually more sophisticated and is implemented in hardware. Error correction
is similar to error detection, except that a receiver not only detects when bit
errors have occurred in the frame but also determines exactly where in the frame
the errors have occurred (and then corrects these errors).</li>

<b>Parity Bit</b> - Appended bit that makes the sum of the number of 1s even or odd depending on the scheme.<br>
