<h1> Notes 8.4.1</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<b>First-Hop (Default) Router</b> - The router that the host is attached to.<br>
<b>Source Router</b> - Default router of source host.<br>
<b>Destination Router</b> - Default router of the destination host.<br>
<b>Shortest Path</b> - Path between 2 nodes in a graph with fewest hops.<br>
<b>Least-Cost Path</b> - Path between 2 nodes in a graph with lowest cost.<br>
<b>Global (Link-State) Routing Algorithm</b> - Computes lowest-cost path between source & destination with <i>global network knowledge</i>.<br>
<b>Decentralized Routing Algorithm</b> - Calculation of least-cost path is done in iterative, distributed manner.<br>
<b>Static Routing Algorithm</b> - Route changes very slowly over time, usually as a result of human intervention.<br>
<b>Dynamic Routing Algorithm</b> - Route changes as network traffic changes.<br>
<b>Load-Sensitive Algorithm</b> - Link costs vary dynamically to reflect congestion.<br>
<b>Loas-Insensitive Algorithm</b> - Link costs do not reflect congestion.<br>
<b>Link-State Broadcast</b> - Each node broadcasts link-state packets containing IDs and costs of nearby nodes to all nodes on the network.<br>
<b>Distance-Vector Algorithm</b> - Iterative, asynchronous, and distributed.<br>
<b>Routing Loop</b> - A packet is routed through the same set of nodes repeatedly.<br>
<b>Autonomous Systems</b> - A group of routers under the same administrative control, all running the same routing algorithm.<br>
<b>Intra-Autonomous System Routing Protocol</b> - The algorithm running within an Autonomous System.<br>
<b>Gateway Routers</b> - Routers that connect Autonomous Systems to other nodes.<br>
<b>Hot-Potato Routing</b> - The Autonomous System gets rid of the packet as soon as possible.<br>
<b>Routing Information Protocol</b> - Distance-Vector protocol with hop count as a cost metric.<br>
<b>RIP Response Message</b> - A list of up to 25 destination subnets within the AS, sent every 30 seconds.<br>
<b>Open Shortest Path First</b> - Link-State protocol that uses flooding of link-state info and a Dijkstra least-cost path algorithm.<br>
<b>Area Border Routers</b> - Responsible for routing packets outside of an OSPF Area.<br>
<b>Backbone Area</b> - One chosen OSPF Area to be the primary traffic routing area.<br>
<b>Border Gate Protocol</b> - Standard inner-AS routing protocol.<br>
<b>BGP Peers</b> - Two routers at the end of a BGP connection.<br>
<b>BGP Session</b> - The messages sent over the connection.<br>
<b>Autonomous System Number</b> - Unique ID for each AS so the BGP can tell them apart.<br>
<b>Import Policy</b> - How a gateway decides to filter a route.<br>
