<h1>Quiz 2</h1>
	<h3>Short Answer</h3>
			<p>1. Describe the key difference(s) between connectionless and connection-oriented transport.</p>
			<br>
			<p>2. Describe the difference between flow control and congestion control in a transport protocol.</p>
			<br>
			<p>3. What information does the "Acknowledgment Number" field in a TCP header hold?</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hover over the next 3 lines to reveal answers:</p>
			<p style="color: palegreen;">1. In connection-oriented transport, there is a handshaking process between the sender and receiver before any payload data is sent. In connectionless, there is not. <br>
			2. Flow control limits sent data in order to prevent buffer overflow on the receiving end. Congestion control limits sent data in response to perceived congestion in the network.<br>
			3. The number of the first byte in the next segment that the sender expects to receive.</p>
		<h3>Multiple Choice</h3>
			<p>1. Which approach to congestion control does TCP utilize?</p>
			<form>
				<input type="radio" name="Answer1" value="End-to-end congestion control"> a. End-to-end congestion control <br>
				<input type="radio" name="Answer1" value="Network-assisted congestion control"> b. Network-assisted congestion control <br>
			</form>
			<p>2. The "Sequence Number" field in a TCP header refers to:</p>
			<form>
				<input type="radio" name="Answer2" value="The number of the packet"> a. The number of the packet <br>
				<input type="radio" name="Answer2" value="The number of the first byte in the packet"> b. The number of the first byte in the packet <br>
			</form>
			<p>3. The term for the amount of unused space in a receiver's buffer is the:</p>
			<form>
				<input type="radio" name="answer3" value="Receive window"> a. Receive window<br>
				<input type="radio" name="answer3" value="Buffer window"> b. Buffer Window<br>
			</form>

				<tr>
					<th>Event</th>
					<th>TCP Receiver Action</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1. Arrival of out-of-order segment with higher-than-expected sequence number. Gap detected.</td>
					<td>a. Immediately send ACK, provided that segment starts at the lower end of gap.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2. Arrival of in-order segment with expected sequence number. All data up to expected sequence number already acknowledged.</td>
					<td>b. Immediately send single cumulative ACK.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3. Arrival of segment that partially or completely fills in gap in received data.</td>
					<td>c. Immediately send duplicate ACK, indicating sequence number of next expected byte.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4. Arrival of in-order segment with expected sequence number. One other in-order segment waiting for ACK transmission. </td>
					<td>d. Delayed ACK. Wait up to 500 msec for arrival of another in-order segment. If next in-order segment does not arrive in this interval, send an ACK.</td>
