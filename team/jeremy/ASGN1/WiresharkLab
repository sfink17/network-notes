	Wireshark Lab: DNS
    </h3>
    <h4>
        By: Jeremy Novak
    </h4>
		<p>
			&emsp;Before deciding to work write this lab report I worked on the Introduction Lab, the HTTP Lab and the DNS Lab.
		</p>
	<h4>
		Lab Introduction
	</h4>
		<p>
	&emsp; The DNS Wireshark lab from the University of Massachusetts provides information about the Domain Name System, and how the system send information to clients. Before starting this lab you should have done the Introduction Lab and the HTTP labs to get a feel for the wireshark program. As the lab recommends you should review section 2.4 of the text as a refresh of how DNS works. As with all the Wireshark labs if you don't have access to the administrator account (compsci, on the school computers) you can download data files to work with from: <br>&emsp;<a href="http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces.zip">http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces.zip</a>.
		</p>
	<h4>
		DNS part 1: <i>nslookup</i>
	</h4>
		<p>
		Follow the instructions in the lab completely, all commands should work on the Cornell system. After you are done with the lab, answer the questions and check your work with the guide below. </p>
	<h4>
		DNS part 2: <i>ipconfig</i> and <i>ifconfig</i>
	</h4>
		<p>
		If you are using a Linux system, please refer to the Manual for information about ifconfig, as the Lab only covers the Windows version. The Manual pages can be found using the command: <i>man ifconfig</i>.</p>
	<h4>
		DNS part 3: Tracing DNS with Wireshark
	</h4>
		<p>
		Follow the instruction in the lab. It is recommended to use the data files provided, as there are a large number of values you will need look up to answer the questions, and the data files have all the relevant data close together. You <b> do not</b> need to annotate the Wireshark outputs unless you find the information useful. After you are done with the lab, answer the questions and check your work with the guide below. <b>Note: </b>Not all the questions are answered in the guide.

	<p>
		<b>DNS part 1: <i>nslookup</i></b><br>
		Questions: <ol>
		<li>Run <i>nslookup</i> to obtain the IP address of a Web server in Asia. What is the IP address of that server?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The IP address of www.korea.net is 104.118.104.19 and 104.118.104.18. <br><br>

		<li>Run <i>nslookup</i> to determine the authoritative DNS servers for a university in Europe.</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The authoritative DNS server for University College Dublin is 205.251.198.147. <br><br>

		<li>Run <i>nslookup</i> so that one of the DNS servers obtained in Question 2 is queried for the mail servers for Yahoo! mail. What is its IP address?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The server couldn't find find mail.yahoo.com and returned REFUSED. <br><br>
		</ol>
		</p><p>
		<b>DNS part 3: Tracing DNS with Wireshark</b><br>
			Questions: <ol>
			<li>Locate the DNS query and response messages. Are then sent over UDP or TCP?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The DNS messages are sent using UDP.<br><br>
			<li>What is the destination port for the DNS query message? What is the source port of DNS response message?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: DNS messages are sent to their destination using port 53, and come from the source port 3163.<br><br>
			<li>To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Use ipconfig to determine the IP address of your local DNS server. Are these two IP addresses the same? </li>
		&emsp;Answer: Not Answered due to Cornell network limitations.<br><br>
			<li>Examine the DNS query message. What &ldquo;Type&rdquo; of DNS query is it? Does the query message contain any &ldquo;answers&rdquo;?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The DNS query message is of Standard &ldquo;Type&rdquo;, the querry message does not contain any &ldquo;answers&rdquo;.<br><br>
			<li>Examine the DNS response message. How many &ldquo;answers&rdquo; are provided? What do each of these answers contain?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The DNS response message contains 2 &ldquo;answers&rdquo;, the answers are the IP addresses information for the website www.ietf.org.<br><br>
			<li>Consider the subsequent TCP SYN packet sent by your host. Does the destination IP address of the SYN packet correspond to any of the IP addresses provided in the DNS response message?</li>
		&emsp;Answer: The TCP SYN packet&lsquo;s destination IP does not match thes destination, however it does match the first IP address in the answer from the DNS response.<br><br>
			<li>This web page contains images. Before retrieving each image, does your host issue new DNS queries? </li>
		&emsp;Answer: Yes the page contains images and there is no second DNS request.<br><br>
