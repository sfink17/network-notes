		Link-State Algorithm Demonstration
	</h3>
	<h4>

	<p>
		This in-class demonstration of how a Link-state Algorithm works requires:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Students eager to participate</li>
		<li>A large open space</li>
			<ul><li> such as a classroom with the desks moved to the side</li></ul>
		<li>A sheet of paper with a simple message written on it, such as &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</li>	
	</ul>
	<p>
		To start this activity describe what a Link-State Algorithm does: That it builds 
		a network of routers and determines the fastest path for a message to travel from 
		one router to a different router, based on the shortest distance between routers. <br><br>
		&emsp;At the start of the activity have several student stand in the middle of the 
		open space, have them stand at irregular intervals and not just in a circle. Tell all the 
		student that they are now routers  each of the routers have the same name as the student. 
		For example a student named Mark would lead to a router named Mark, this router and its 
		functions would be performed by the student Mark. Each student should be standing at 
		irregular interval throughout the space. Ask the students to find the &ldquo;routers&rdquo; 
		that are closest to them. Give the sheet of paper with the message on it. Tell the students 
		that the message must be passed to a different student in the router network, and it 
		can only be passed to the routers near them. This step should continue until the 
		message reaches its destination. Repeat this step several times. This demonstrates how the a 
		Link-State Algorithm works under normal conditions, with each router sending messages to the 
		router that leads to the shortest path to the destination. For the sake of simplicity have 
		the student estimate the shortest path for the message to take rather than measure the exact 
		distance.<br><br>
		&emsp; Once the students have passed the message back and forth several times, ask 
		one of the students in the middle of the space to sit down, this should disrupt the network 
		that was created when the student passes messages. Have student pass the message making 
		sure that the missing person would have been used to pass the message. This demonstrates 
		how the network rebuilds after a router is lost. If you have time give the distance between 
		each student a distance or weight. Student should use this weight to send the messages to other 
		using the &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; path.
