	<P>
	Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): are fixed length headers that allowed for improved forwarding speeds from ISP in the mid-to-late 90's.

	<P> The MPLS Header inserted into a packet (above) is added when two devices capable of using the header communicate. The headers parts and uses are listed as follows:</p>
	<UL>
		<LI>A 20-bit label number. A label with the value of 1 represents the router alert label</LI>
		<LI>A 3-bit Traffic Class field for quality of service priority and  Congestion Notification, used to be called EXP bits</LI>
		<LI>A 1-bit bottom of stack flag. If this is set, it signifies that the current label is the last in the stack</LI>
		<LI>An 8-bit TTL field</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>
	This header sits between the Ethernet header and the IP header, or the layer 2 and layer 3 headers respectively. 
	A router capable of MPLS is often called a label-switched router. <BR>
	As far as this textbook is concerned the main and technical importance of MPLS's starts and ends with 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>The knowledge that MPLS's can be used to forward packets along routes that would otherwise be impossible to us</LI>
		<LI>The ability to use MPLS's to avoid network congestion</LI>
		<LI>The use of MPLS's in virtual private networks(VPNs)</LI>
	</UL>
