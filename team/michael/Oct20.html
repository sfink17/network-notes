    <button class="accordion">Data field</button>
<div class="panel">
    <ul>
        <li>Size: 36 to 1500 Bytes</li>

    </ul>
  <p>This field holds the IP datagram. The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is 1500 bytes. If the datagram
      exceeds 1500 bytes the host fragments the datagram. If the datagram is less than 46 bytes the 
      datagram must be stuffed. The network layer will remover the stuffing using the datagram header length field.
  </p>
</div>
    
      <button class="accordion">Destination address</button>
<div class="panel">
    <ul>
        <li>Size: 6 Bytes</li>

    </ul>
  <p>This field contains the MAC address of the destination adapter. The adapter passes the contenets of the frame's data field to 
      the network layer. 
  </p>
</div>

  <button class="accordion">Source Address</button>
<div class="panel">
    <ul>
        <li>Size: 6 Bytes</li>

    </ul>
  <p>Contains the MAC address of the adapter that
transmits the frame onto the LAN</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Type Field</button>
<div class="panel">
    <ul>
        <li>Size: 2 Bytes</li>
        <li>Permits Ethernet to multiplex network-layer protocols</li>
<li> Hosts can use other network-layer protocols besides IP, and multiple ones</li>
<li>Adapter has to demultiplex the type field to know which network-layer protocol it should pass the contents of the data field</li>
    <li>IP and other network-layer protocols each have their own type number</li>
    <li> The type field is analogous to the protocol field in the networklayer
datagram and the port-number fields in the transport-layer segment</li>
    </ul>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)</button>
<div class="panel">
     <ul>
        <li>Size: 2 Bytes</li>
        <li> CRC field allows the receiving adapter to detect bit errors in the frame.</li>
     </ul>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Preamble</button>
<div class="panel">
     <ul>
        <li>Size: 8 Bytes</li>
        <li>First 7 bytes of the preamble has a value of 10101010</li>
        <li> last byte is 10101011</li>
        <li> First 7 bytes of the preamble serve to awaken the receiving adapters and to sync their clocks to 
            that of the sender’s clock</li>
            <li> there will always be some drift from the target rate, a drift which is not known by the other adapters on
the LAN</li>
<li> The last 2 bits of the eighth byte
of the preamble tell the adapter that the rest of the data is about to come</li>
     </ul>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<p>Ethernet technologies provide connectionless service to the network layer. The sending adapter puts the datagram
     in an ethernet frame and sends in into the LAN with a handshake with the receiving adapter. This is an unreliable service to the network layer.
