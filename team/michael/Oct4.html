	<h2>Malware</h2>
	<p>Malware is malicious software. Malware can install things, steal information or delete files without the owner of the computer even knowing. A collection of infected computers is called a botnet. Most malware is self-replicating where it looks for new hosts from its current host. Worms are malware that enter through vulnerable network applications without user interaction. A virus enters a system through user interaction such as opening an email attatchement.
	Another attack known as denial-of-service (DoS), makes networking infrastructures unusable. Three types of DoS are Vulnerablitlity attacks, Bandwith flooding, connection flooding. 
<ul>
	<li>Vulnerability - messages to specific application that craches or stops host</li>
	<li>Bandwith flooding - clogging access link with packets</li>
	<li>Connection flooding - uses numerous TCP connections so the host stops accepting legit connections</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<h2>Origins of Network Technology</h2>
<p>
