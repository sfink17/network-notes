Broadcast Routing Algorithms

     <button class="accordion">N-way unicast</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Given N destination nodes, the source router makes
N copies of a packet, addresses each packet to a different destination, and transmits the 
N packets to the destinations. No new network routing protocol,
packet-duplication, or forwarding is neccessary.</p>
<p>Drawbacks</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inefficiency:If the source node is connected to the network through a single link, then N separate
copies of the same packet will go through this single link</li>
<li>broadcast membership or destination-registration protocol required for additional information like broadcast recipients, and
their addresses</li>
<li>adds more overhead and complexity</li>
</ul>
</div>

<body>
     <button class="accordion">Uncontrolled Flooding</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Technique for achieving broadcast in which the source node sends a copy of the 
      packet to all of its neighbors. If the graph is connected, 
      it will eventually deliver a copy of the packet to all nodes in the graph</p>
      <p>Drawbacks</p>
      <ul>
          <li>If the graph has cycles, a copy each broadcast packet could cycle forever</li>
          <li>Broadcast storm:a node is connected to more than two nodes, it creates and forwards 
              multiple copies of the packet, each of which creates multiple copies of itself. </li>
              <li>Endless multiplication of broadcast packets renders the network useless.</li>
      </ul>
</div>
<body>
     <button class="accordion">Controlled Flooding</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>To avoid a broadcast storm a node msut choose when
to flood a packet, or not flood a packet. In sequence-number-controlled flooding, 
a source node puts its addresses
 as well as a broadcast sequence number into a broadcast
packet, then sends the packet to all of its neighbors. Each node has a list of
the source address and sequence number of all packets it has 
received, duplicated, and forwarded. </p>
<p>Reverse path forwarding (RPF), also referred to as reverse path broadcast (RPB), is when a router 
    receives a broadcast packet with a given source address, it transmits the packet on all 
    of its outgoing links if the packet arrived on the link that is on its own shortest 
    unicast path back to the source. Else, the router sicards the packet.
