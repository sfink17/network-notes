Routing Algorithms

    <button class="accordion">Default Router/First-Hop Router</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The router a host is typically attached to. When a host sends a packet,
it is transferred to its default router.</p>
</div>

    <button class="accordion">Source Router</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The default router of the source host</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Destination Router</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> The default router of the destination host</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Purpose of routing algorithms</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> a routing algorithm finds a path from source router to destination router given a set of routers with connecting links</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Graphs</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> A graph is used to formulate routing problems. A graph <i>G= (N,E)</i> is a set of N nodes and E edges.
   Where each edge is a pair of nodes from N.

   </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Paths</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A path in a graph <i>G=(N,E)</i> is a sequence of nodes  (x1, x2,..., x<i>n</i>) 
   such that each pair (x1, x2) are edges in E.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Least-Cost Paths</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> A path between the source and destination that has
least cost. If all edges in the graph have the same cost, the least-cost path is also the shortest path</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Shortest Paths</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> The path with the smallest number of links between the source and the destination</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Global routing algorithm</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> Computes the least-cost path between source and destination with complete global knowledge of the network.
       takes all nodes and link costs a input. It can be calculated at one site or repplicated at multiple sites. Algorithms with global
state information are often referred to as link-state (LS) algorithms.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Decentralized routing algorithm</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Calculation of least-cost path is carried out in an iterative and distributed manner. Nodes do 
      not have complet informaiton about all nodes and links. Nodes only begin with knowledge of their directly
       connected links. A node gradually calculates the least-cost path to a destination or set of
destinations
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Distance-vector algortihm (DV)</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Each node maintains a vector of estimates of costs (distances) to al other nodes in the network.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Static routing algorithms</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Routes change slowly over time as a result of human interaction such as a forwarding table being changed.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Dynamic routing algorithms</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Changes the routing paths as the network traffic loads change. Dynamic algorithms are more responsive to network changes, they are also more
susceptible to problems such as routing loops.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Load-sensitive algorithm</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Link costs vary dynamically to refelect levels of congestion in links. Load-sensitive algorithms will tend to
choose routes around such a congested link</p>
</div>
