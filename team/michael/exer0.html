<p>Questions are in white. Answers are in orange</p>

<p>What is P2P networking?</p>
<p class = "p3">It is where applications exploit communication between two connected hosts called <i>peers</i>. Becuase these hosts communicate directly, it is called a  <i>peer-to-peer</i> connection.</p>
<p>What is a bottleneck?</p>
<p class="p3">A node in a network that has a lower throughput than other nodes.</p>
<p>How would one calculate a propagation delay?</p>
<p class = "p3">It can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium.</p>
<p>What is Traceroute?</p>
<p class="p3">A utility that records the specific gateway computers at each node through the internet between your computer and the destination.</p>
<p>What is the transmission rate of Ethernet LANs?</p>
<p class = "p3">10 Mbps</p>
<p>What is a physical form media that Ethernet can run over?</p>
<p class = "p3">Coaxial Cable - Twisted pair Copper Wire - Fiber Optic</p>
<p>Why are standards important for protocols?</p>
<p class="p3">They are important so people can create networking systems and products that interoperate.</p>
<p>What is the difference between a virus and a worm?</p>
<p class= "p3">Worms are similar to viruses in that they replicate functional copies of themselves and cause the same damage. Viruses requires spreading of an infected host file, and worms are standalone that do not require a host program or human to propogate</p>

<h2>Norman Abramson</h2>
<p>Abramson created the first wireless local area network. Its birthplace was in Hawaii, hence its name ALOHAnet. It was designed and developed at the University of Hawaii. It was the first network to successfully transmit data using radio signals. Data transmission between islands was a essential and ALOHAnet was the solution. ALOHAnet used high speed data packets, AKA ALOHA channels, to transmit data over radio frequencies. This has been used in every generation of mobile broadband. Abramson's ALOHAnets packet broadcast technology was a revolutionary advance over the switched-circuit data technologies of the time. Ironically enough, Abramson's wirelss technology helped in the design of the Ethernet, which was made by Robert Metcalfe.</p>

<h2>Instructions for GitHub</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a new repository: git init</li>
<li>Create a working copy of a local repository by:git clone /path/to/repository</li>
<p>Your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. the first one is your Working Directory which holds the actual files. the second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.</p>
<li>propose changes: git add < filename >  or  git add *</li>
<li>commit these changes: git commit -m "Commit message" </li>
<li>pushing changes: git push origin master</li>
<p>If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with</p>
<li>git remote add origin < server ></li>
<li>update & merge:git pull</li>
<p>in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.
to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use</p>
<li>git merge < branch ></li>
<h3>Useful hints</h3>
<li>built-in git GUI : gitk</li>
<li>use colorful git output : git config color.ui true</li>

</ul>
