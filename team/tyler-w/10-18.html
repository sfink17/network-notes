		<h3>Broadcast Routing</h3>
		
		<p>In <b>broadcast routing</b>, the network layer provides a service of delivering a packet sent from a source node
		to all other nodes in the network.</p>
		
		<p>One approach to accomplish broadcast communication is the <b>N-way-unicast</b> approach. In this approach, given
		<i>N</i> destination nodes, the source node makes <i>N</i> copies of the packet, addresses each copy to a different
		destination, and then transmits the <i>N</i> copies to the <i>N</i> destinations using unicast routing.</p>
		
		<p>No new network-layer routing protocol, packet-duplication, or forwarding functionality is needed. However, there
		are problems with this approach (<i>Diagram a.</i>):</p>

		<ul><li><b>Not efficient</b>: It would be more efficient for the network nodes themselves to create only a single copy
		of the packet that traverses a link, rather than creating many copies to send over many links.</li><br>
			<li><b>Additional protocols required to get receivers</b>: More protocol mechanisms, such as broadcast membership
			or destination-registration protocol, would be required. This would add more overhead and additional complexity to
			a simple protocol.</li><br>
			<li>In situations where broadcast is used to create and update unicast routes, it would not be smart to rely on the
			unicast routing infrastructure to achieve broadcast.</li><br>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Uncontrolled and Controlled Flooding</h4>
		
		<p><b>Flooding</b> is an approach in which the source node sends a copy of the packet to all of its neighbors. Eventually,
		every node in the graph will receive a copy of the broadcast packet. Unfortunately, there is a flaw: If the graph has
		cycles, then one or more copies of each broadcast packet will cycle indefinitely. It will also create and forward multiple
		copies of the broadcast packet, each of which will create multiple copies of itself. This is called a <b>broadcast storm</b>,
		and would render the network useless.</p>
		
		<p>The key to avoiding a broadcast storm is for a node to choose when to or not to flood a packet, checking if it already
		received and flooded an earlier copy of the packet. In <b>sequence-number-controlled-flooding</b>, a source node puts its
		address/unique identifier and <b>broadcast sequence number</b> into a broacast packet, and then sends it to all of its
		neighbors.</p>
		
		<p>Another approach to controlled flooding is <b>reverse path forwarding (RPF)</b>. When a router receives a broadcast packet
		with a given source address, it transmits the packet on all of its outgoing links, except the one it received from, only if the
		packet arrived on the link that is on its own shortest unicast path back to the source. The picture below illustrates RPF:</p>

		<h4>Spanning Tree Broadcast</h4>
		
		<p>Sequence-number-controlled flooding and RPF avoid broadcast storms, but they do not completely avoid the transmission
		of redundant packets. A <b>spanning-tree</b> is a tree that contains each and every node in a graph. If each link has
		an associated cost and the cost of a tree is the sum of the link costs, then a spanning tree whose cost is the minimum of
		all the graph's spanning trees is called a <b>minimum spanning tree</b>.</p>

		<p>In the <b>center-based approach</b> to building a spanning tree, a center node is defined. Nodes then unicast
		tree-join messages addressed to the center node. A tree-join message is forwarded using unicast routing toward the
		center until it either arrives at a node that already belongs to a spanning tree or arrives at the center.</p>
